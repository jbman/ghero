    ghero.h - Library for connecting a Wii Guitar Hero controller to the Arduino

    This library decodes the data send by a Wii Guitar Hero controller. 
    It was developed with a Logitech Guitar Hero controller. It may also work for other 
    Wii guitar hero controllers, but it isn't tested.

    The guitar is connected to the arduino with the help of a small passive adapter ("nunchuk adapter f√ºr arduino").
    The releavant output pins of this adapter are '+', '-', 'd' and 'c':
    - is connected to GND on arduino
    + is connected to +3,3V on arduino
    d is connected to SDA pin (A4 on arduino nano)
    c is connected to SCL pin (A5 on arduino nano)
